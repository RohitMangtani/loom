# Hive

An operating system for directing AI labor. Daemon, dashboard, and coordination layer for running multiple Claude Code agents simultaneously on one machine.

## The Problem

AI labs are building smarter individual agents. Nobody is building infrastructure for managing fleets of them. One agent is a tool. Four agents editing the same codebase without coordination is chaos — duplicate work, file conflicts, idle time from unattended permission prompts.

This is the pre-Kubernetes moment for AI agents. Docker solved the single container. Someone has to solve orchestration.

## What Hive Does

Hive is a local daemon that auto-discovers running Claude Code instances, tracks their status in real-time, and provides coordination primitives so multiple agents can work the same machine without stepping on each other.

**Auto-discovery** — Detects running Claude processes within 3 seconds. Zero configuration.

**Status detection** — Three-layer pipeline reads session telemetry, JSONL logs, and process signals to determine whether each agent is working (green), idle (red), or stuck waiting for input (yellow).

**Auto-pilot** — Monitors for permission prompts and auto-approves routine operations within a grace window. Prevents agents from sitting idle waiting for a human to press Enter.

**Coordination** — Five primitives for multi-agent safety:
- Inter-agent messaging
- Advisory file locks
- Shared scratchpad (ephemeral, auto-expiring)
- Artifact tracking (which agent modified which files)
- Conflict detection (warns before editing a file another agent recently touched)

**Compound learning** — Persistent project-level knowledge files that accumulate across agents and sessions. Solved a tricky build issue? The next agent in that project reads the solution automatically.

**Daemon** — TypeScript process running via macOS `launchd` with `KeepAlive`. Scans every 3 seconds. Exposes REST endpoints for task queues, locks, messaging, and learnings. WebSocket server pushes live state to the dashboard.

**Dashboard** — Next.js app showing agent status, live chat streams, and controls for spawning/killing agents. Accessible locally or via tunnel.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Stack |
|-----------|-------|
| Daemon | TypeScript, Express, WebSocket (`ws`) |
| Dashboard | Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Build | Turborepo workspaces |
| Process management | macOS `launchd` + `caffeinate` |
| TTY interaction | `osascript` + CGEvent binary for reliable keystroke injection |

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, macOS (daemon uses AppleScript + CGEvent for TTY interaction)

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/RohitMangtani/hive.git
cd hive
npm install

# Copy environment template (all vars have sensible defaults)
cp .env.example .env

# Start the daemon (runs on ports 3001 + 3002)
npm run dev:daemon

# In another terminal, start the dashboard
npm run dev:dashboard

# Set up Claude Code hooks (connects agents to the daemon)
bash setup-hooks.sh
```

The daemon auto-discovers any running Claude Code instance within 3 seconds. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` to see agent status.

See `.env.example` for all available configuration options.

## How It Was Built

Hive was built using the agents it manages. Four Claude Code instances iterated on the daemon and dashboard simultaneously while a human directed architecture and resolved conflicts. The coordination primitives exist because the development process demanded them.
